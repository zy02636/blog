title: About Kant
---

It costs me several months to read "This Critique of Pure Reason" and I do not finish it. The content of this book is quite notorious difficult to understand. All the concepts introduced by Kant are quite obsolete from real world experience. It may a bit awkward to say that you have to imagine the meaning of a term and set a temporary understanding of it. After dozens of elaboration of this term across the book with various context, you may have a better understanding of it. This situation applies to most terms invented by Kant. As a result, people may have vast amount of interpretation about Kant and his philosophies. It appears meaningless to have a discussion about subject concepts without mapped real world  object, since it is difficult to convincing people without solid evidence. Even with solid evidence, people can still argue its validity by some concepts relate to it. So, what we suppose to do to deal with this issue? Shut up, and do your work. Like Linux Torvalds said "Talk is cheap, show me the code".
