title: English Writing Exercise - 01
---
Apologize first for my reckless and unproved words here. As a human being, with a proper function brain, I do not have enough energy to verity each piece of information that I received. The only thing I can do is to make less judgment and listen more. Acting correspond to this rule makes me more like a listener than producer. This communication habit has undermined my English writing skill. OK, it can be argued that there is a contradiction between be a listener and be a skilled writer. I just mean it is urgent for me to improve my English writing skills.

There are so many motivations for me to improve my writing skills. The major one is my wife. When I was an adolescent, most of my behavior was largely affected by frontal lobes, in short I was an assXXX. Therefore my mid-school performance was not that outstanding. As a result, my understanding of English grammar was nearly blank. I had no clear concept of verb, noun, article, adjecent, adverb and so on. Due to the immature understanding of English grammar, I faced big trouble of English writing. As you may now recognize, sentences that constructed by me may have very loose semantic meanings and relations. I do not know how to compose a clear and structured essay. Oh, about my wife, because she makes fun of my grammar mistake, so I decide to improve my English grammar both oral and written.
