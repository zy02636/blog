<p>Weather of Hangzhou in March is very strange, it is more like winter than spring, grim wind blows on each of its raining day, it is damp and cold. Perhaps the best activity on March raining day is reading a good book at home. If you are lucky enough, reading a great book during weekend could fuel your brain and get you well prepared for next week working. You may got inspirations from a historical novel for a software architecture problem, or got a well structured plan for the conducting of team culture building because of the reading of a book about the psychology of group behaviour. We are living in a world that full of knowledge but also facing the problem of information explosion and overloading. People are accepting too much information as well as noises simultaneously. It is easier and much more difficult to make a choice on reading a book.</p>

<p>We are living in the world that have various way to absorb your attention constantly, day and night, such as phone calls, App notifications, TVs, advertisements, newspapers and so on. Along with the development of technology, the outside world capture the attention of people in a more frequent and close way. The first thing you do in the morning when you get up is watching the messages or stories that delivered by the apps. You may download several movies for watching during your way to work or home, or you may keeping pull to refresh your tweets or Facebook timeline to check out what is happening that far away from you. We are spending more and more time on something that is isolated from our surrounding, we are more eager to know something which is remote and strange. Attention is never so rare and cheap. We feel lonely and unsecured if there is no phone in our hands, we feel uncomfortable if we are just standing on a bus, we are never so much eager to know everything which turns out we know nothing at all. Most of the information we have got is meaningless and worthless. After all, it would be much more difficult for people to choose a proper book to read because of the unceasing interruption of surrounding noises fragmented the thinking of peopleâ€™s mind.</p>

<p>Time is rare, and it is even rarer to have your attention well spend during a certain slot of time. Most people living in a repeated life without truly understanding of what is living. They are often too busy to think about their life. Perhaps they are afraid of being doing nothing, they need to find something to fill their time, like a hungry man stuck his stomach by whatever he grabs. We need to slow down, we need to used to do nothing, and we need to read a proper book to make our brain excluding our minds. Take it slow, take it easy, life requires your valuable attention and you will gradually know what is important for you and your life.</p>
