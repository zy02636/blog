<p>It has been a while since my last post. Heavy working schdule has debilitated my writing interest and now I’m back. Today’s topic is about the book “Antifragile” which is written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. It costs me nearly a month to finish this book, you can say my reading speed is slow, and I have forgot content of previous chapters. Following comments on this book could involve my misunderstanding of this book. If there is anything wrong you may send me an e-mail as a way of proofreading.</p>

<p>This book major idea is about risk management and decision making. It expounds the concept of fragile and antifragile as a way to make better life decision. Object with fragility afraid of variables, instability, changes; favour stability and sustained environment. On the contrary, antifragile object will become stronger and powerful in terms of facing flunctuations and instability. Robust is a middle state between fragile and antifragile. It is stronger than fragile but eventuall will break when persistent change happens. According to the example story of this book may help you to have further understanding of these concepts. Local restaurants are fragile; they are contending with each other which makes local restaurant antifragile. Human being is fragile; gens carried by human is antifragile. Now, here is my understanding of what is fragile and antifragile. Fragile refers to obejct that has fixed elements in it; the higher importance of these elements have, the higher level of fragility object possesses. Antifragile object holds features that constantly evolving as a response to external envrionment.</p>

<p>Optionality, barbell effects and path dependency are three important concepts introduced to explain why antifragile helps to make better decision. Tabel states that risk taking are not gambling, and optionality are not lottery tickets. Optionality, in the eye of fragilist it is dangerous, exhibits the very notion of evolving and allows nature the chose the best solution. For individuals, we may apply trail and error strategy to make decision. Process of decison making is dynamic, wisdom lies in action. Therefore, enlarge optionality helps people to test ideas and decisions in possible ways. Barbell effects means asymmetry, situation with unbalanced upside and downside.</p>

<p>In the end of this book author offers way to make better decision. The main idea is via subtraction and negative.</p>
