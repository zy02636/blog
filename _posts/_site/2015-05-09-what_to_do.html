<p>Ok, it costs me several hours to build this static blog and hope I will use it in following years. Two things to do in following months. First, finish the “Let over lambda”. Second use Common Lisp to re-develop LLVM. First target I may have a little clue how to finsh it. Second one? em.. hope I can hold my promise and I will create a git repository to trace the process.</p>
