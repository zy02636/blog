title: About Change and Automation
---
Changing is not welcomed by most people, because its potentail damage to people's comfortable zone. In the early years of my career, changing seems never be a serious issue for me. During that time I was young, vigorous, energetic and full of potentials and possibilities. After four years of being software test engineer, career anxiety rises. The major reason is the difficulty of practicing test techinques in real world test project.

Mobile application test engineers spend most of their time in requirement analysis, test case design, test case review, test case execution, bug trace. For any people graduated from any discipline, these steps can be well mastered in only two or three years, maybe more time is required if test project requires very specific professional knowledge, such as financial software. If a STE requires further career development, he has to choose to be a test manager or test specialist.

The career path to be a test specialist is more difficult than be a test manager. The core target for test specialist is using test code to examine   the behaviour of software in various ways and levels, such as function test, unit test, UI test, performance test which includes batter usages, network traffic, FPS, UI render time and so on. Most test skills seem straight forward at first glance, but many engineer problems eventually rises while implementing them. For instance, UI automation is a very common test technique which is involved in the process of automation and it needs to face the challenge comes from constant UI changing. Cost of maintaining UI automation test codes of mobile application could be enormous, and outcome can be very limited comparing to its cost. Perhaps the goal of UI automation is never ensuring function validity of each UI page, but only preventing vital defect before the releasing of new version software.

Most automation techniques tend to fail because of the short life cycle of mobile application code. As a result, most test engineers focus on specific performance behaviours of mobile application, such as memory leaks checking, FPS calculating, battery usages monitoring. Indeed, figures of these fields can be more easily obtained and require less manual maintenance. If a STE wants to improve his test techniques, these test fields are very good choice. With the consideration of importance of unit test, the possibility of continuous integration in mobile application development should be explored. Topic of CI will be further discussed in following chapters.
